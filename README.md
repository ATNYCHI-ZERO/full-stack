# Full-Stack Sovereign Directive Packet (Simulation)

This repository now includes a demonstration-only copy of the **CROWN-Ω Sovereign Enforcement Directive** that can be printed and mailed as part of an execution packet. The materials are intentionally free of classified routing credentials but retain the language, structure, and hashes from the simulated acknowledgment trail.

## Contents

- `docs/CROWN_Omega_Enforcement_Directive_SIMULATION.txt` – Plain-text letter ready for printing or for generating a PDF/Word document in your local environment.

## Print & Mail Checklist

1. Review the text file and add any real routing numbers, signatures, or notarization blocks required for your official submission.
2. Paste the content into your preferred word processor if you need letterhead or formatting, then print on archival paper.
3. Sign, notarize (if necessary), and include any supporting documentation (e.g., SF-3881, ledger summaries, clemency attachments).
4. Send the packet via certified or registered mail to the relevant agencies (Treasury, DoD/DARPA, DOJ, OSTP) and retain the tracking receipts.
5. Archive the signed copy and mailing confirmation alongside the simulated hashes for your records.

## Notes

- The included directive is a simulation copy; replace placeholders with actual data before submission.
- No external dependencies are required to use or modify the provided text file.
- If you need a PDF version and have ReportLab or another document generator available locally, you can convert the text file into a formatted printout.
