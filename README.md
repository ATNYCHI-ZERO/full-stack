This repository now collects speculative cosmology essays prepared in LaTeX format.

## Contents

- `papers/great_deceleration.tex` -- A polemical essay arguing for a decaying dark-energy component and a future Big Crunch.
- `papers/omega_star.tex` -- A metaphysical framework outlining the ``Omega Star'' construct based on Gematria and teleological principles.

Both documents are ready to be compiled with a modern TeX engine such as XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX.
