# TRI-CROWN 2.0 Reference Suite

This repository tracks the TRI-CROWN 2.0 post-quantum hybrid encryption suite specification and reference materials.

* [Specification overview](docs/TRICROWN2.md)

The suite combines ML-KEM, Classic McEliece, and X25519 key exchanges with key-committing AEAD, deterministic nonces, and periodic PQ refresh to provide robust protection against classical and quantum adversaries.
