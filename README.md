# PSI-ENERGY Unified Stack

This repository contains a Python implementation of the PSI-ENERGY Unified Stack (Ψ-Energy Harmonic Control System). The script generates the wave-function-derived force and energy curves and stores a plot to `psi_energy_plot.png` when executed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Running the Simulation

```bash
python psi_energy.py
```

The script will emit `--- Ψ-ENERGY STACK SYSTEM READY ---` and create a PNG file with the plotted force and energy traces.
