# Crown \u03a9\xb0 Master Integration Plan

## 0. Charter

Deliver all requested paths\u2014formal research, practical tooling, and applied
cryptography\u2014woven into one coherent program. This is a living blueprint, not
final gospel.

---

## 1. Formal Operator-Algebra Path

### 1.1 New Operator Family

*Working name:* **\u03a9\*** (Omega-Star)

* Construction: start with Walsh\u2013Hadamard (H_n) but inject a parameterized
  phase matrix (P_\u03b8) on non-commuting blocks, yielding ``\u03a9*_n = P_\u03b8 H_n P_\u03b8^{-1}``.
* Objective: prove non-trivial eigen-spectrum properties not reducible to
  standard WHT.

### 1.2 First Target Theorem

**Theorem A (Spectral Dispersion Lower Bound).** For any non-zero vector
``v \in \mathbb{R}^{2^k}``, the L1-norm of ``\u03a9*_n v`` is bounded below by \u2026
(full statement and proof sketch placeholder).

*Milestone M1:* complete full proof and peer review draft.

## 2. Cryptographic Integration Path

### 2.1 Hardness Backbone

Adopt **Ring-LWE** (Kyber-class) for public-key exchange.

### 2.2 \u03a9* Mixing Layer

After Ring-LWE key agreement, pass the shared secret ``s`` through the \u03a9*
 spectral mixer plus a SHA-3 domain separator to obtain the final session key.

### 2.3 Deliverables

* `crown_crypto.py` \u2013 Ring-LWE wrapper + \u03a9* mixer.
* Security proof linking the mixer to IND-CCA security (hybrid argument).

---

## 3. Complexity & P\u2260NP Research Path

Define the **Crown Complexity Index (CCI)** based on the Kolmogorov proxy change
under \u03a9* iterations plus a circuit-depth estimator.

Goal: show there exists a language where CCI diverges while Kolmogorov
complexity plateaus, separating certain AC^0 subclasses (incremental,
exploratory).

---

## 4. PDE / Navier\u2013Stokes Path

### 4.1 \u03a9* Spectral Galerkin Scheme

Replace the Fourier basis with \u03a9* eigenfunctions and run a high-resolution
simulation to probe blow-up criteria.

### 4.2 Analytical Angle

Attempt an energy inequality in the \u03a9* basis; if successful, derive a
smoothness bound for restricted initial conditions.

---

## 5. Practical Toolset Path

* Maintain `crown_omega_core.py` (v2) for signal-processing / steganography use.
* Provide CLI utilities: encode, decode, spectral visualize.

---

## 6. Integration Strategy

1. **Modular Repos**
   * `/algebra` \u2013 LaTeX + SymPy proofs.
   * `/crypto` \u2013 Ring-LWE + \u03a9* mixer implementation.
   * `/pde` \u2013 \u03a9* Galerkin notebooks + results.
2. **Unified Docs** \u2013 master README linking modules, build scripts, and test
   harness.
3. **Release Cycle** \u2013 v0.1 (internal proof-of-concept) \u2192 v0.5 (peer
   preprint) \u2192 v1.0 (public).
