# Review of "A Formal Proof of P \u2260 NP" by Brendon J. Kelly

This document records an editorial review of the manuscript provided on September 26, 2025 claiming to prove that $\text{P} \neq \text{NP}$.

## Summary of the Manuscript

The manuscript proposes to encode decision problems of length $n$ as vectors in a $2^n$-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{F}_2$ and argues that the languages in $\text{P}$ span a subspace of "sub-exponential" dimension. It then claims that the solution vector of SAT is not contained in this subspace, thereby concluding $\text{P} \subsetneq \text{NP}$.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Unsupported Dimensionality Bound for $W_{P,n}$

The proof asserts that the subspace spanned by the solution vectors of languages in $\text{P}$ has sub-exponential dimension because each polynomial-time Turing machine has a succinct description. However, the argument confuses the number of descriptions with the linear span of the corresponding vectors. Even if only exponentially many vectors are generated, those vectors can still span the entire space. A rigorous upper bound on the dimension requires showing that every vector in $W_{P,n}$ can be written as a linear combination of at most $f(n)$ basis vectors with $f(n) = 2^{o(n)}$. No such bound is established.

### 2. Misapplication of Kolmogorov Complexity

The manuscript claims that vectors produced by polynomial-time machines must have low Kolmogorov complexity. Kolmogorov complexity measures the length of the shortest program generating a string, but many strings of high Kolmogorov complexity can still be generated by polynomial-time programs (for instance, by hard-coding the string). Conversely, a language in $\text{P}$ can have arbitrarily high Kolmogorov complexity when viewed as the characteristic vector for inputs of length $n$. Thus, Kolmogorov complexity does not yield the desired structural separation.

### 3. Non Sequitur in the SAT Argument

The argument assumes that because SAT is NP-complete, its solution vectors cannot reside in a "simple" subspace. NP-completeness, however, provides no direct information about the linear independence of solution vectors in $\mathbb{F}_2^{2^n}$. Showing that $v_{\text{SAT},n}$ is outside $W_{P,n}$ would require explicit linear-algebraic reasoning, not appeals to cryptographic intuition or "computational irreducibility."

### 4. Reliance on Cryptographic Assumptions

The manuscript appeals to the existence of one-way functions to derive a contradiction. Yet the existence of one-way functions is itself open and equivalent to $\text{P} \neq \text{NP}$ in many formulations. Using this assumption as evidence creates circular reasoning rather than a contradiction within established mathematics.

### 5. Lack of Formal Contradiction

The proof by contradiction never identifies a concrete, previously established theorem that is violated under the assumption $v_{\text{SAT},n} \in W_{P,n}$. Instead, it relies on intuitive statements like "known not to exist" or "lacks simple structure." Without a formal contradiction, the argument is incomplete.

## Conclusion

The manuscript does not provide a valid proof that $\text{P} \neq \text{NP}$. Key steps rely on unproven assumptions, informal intuition, or misapplications of complexity-theoretic concepts. A correct proof would need precise, formal bounds connecting the dimensionality of $W_{P,n}$ with the membership of SAT, which the manuscript does not deliver.
