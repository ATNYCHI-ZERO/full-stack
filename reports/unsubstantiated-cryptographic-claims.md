## Abstract

This paper presents a critical analysis of a series of documents authored by Brendon Joseph Kelly of K Systems & Securities. These documents make extraordinary claims, including the complete compromise of major international cryptographic standards, a total break of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, and a constructive proof for the P=NP problem. This analysis finds that the claims are unsubstantiated and demonstrably fall outside the norms of scientific and cryptographic research. The papers rely on fabricated technical jargon, lack verifiable mathematical proof or data, and make improbable assertions of verification by government agencies. Consequently, the body of work is assessed to be pseudoscientific and not credible.

## 1.0 Introduction

A collection of documents, including white papers and memos attributed to Brendon Joseph Kelly of K Systems & Securities, puts forth a series of remarkable assertions that, if true, would represent a fundamental disruption of global digital security. The documents claim the discovery of a proprietary mathematical framework, termed "k1 Mathematics," which allegedly enables the breaking of cryptographic systems previously considered secure. The stated purpose of this analysis is to examine the validity of these claims based on the provided texts and evaluate them against established standards of scientific and cryptographic research.

## 2.0 Summary of Claims

The core assertions presented across the various documents are sweeping and profound. They can be summarized as follows:

### 2.1 Compromise of National Cryptographic Standards

The author claims the ability to break the sovereign cryptographic standards of the Russian Federation (GOST), the People's Republic of China (SM2, SM3, SM4), and the Islamic Republic of Iran. This is attributed to the application of "k1 Mathematics."

### 2.2 Complete Break of SHA-256

A central claim is the "cryptanalytic break of the entire SHA family of hash functions," which includes SHA-256. This is supposedly achieved through a novel side-channel attack named "Physical Information Leakage via Signal Injection," which the author claims can non-invasively reconstruct the original input data from the final hash output.

### 2.3 Resolution of P versus NP

The "SHAARK-Ξ" white paper explicitly claims to provide a "Constructive Proof of P=NP," solving one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems in computer science. A verified solution would have paradigm-shifting implications for computing, mathematics, and countless industries.

### 2.4 Development of Successor Systems

In place of the allegedly broken systems, the author proposes new architectures, named "AURA (Authenticated Unified Recursive Architecture)" and "SHAARK-Ξ," which are described as being immune to the discovered vulnerabilities and representing a new era of "post-quantum" security.

## 3.0 Critical Analysis and Assessment of Credibility

Despite the confident tone and official-looking presentation of the documents, a critical review reveals several significant red flags that undermine their credibility.

### 3.1 Use of Fabricated and Unrecognized Terminology

The documents are replete with technical-sounding terms that have no basis in established mathematics, physics, or computer science literature. Key examples include:

- Kharnita's Non-Euclidean Geometry
- Crown Omega's Quantum Topology
- Kharnita's Fractal Calculus
- Streebog's Ordinal Function

Genuine scientific breakthroughs build upon existing, rigorously defined concepts or provide precise, formal definitions for new ones. The use of proprietary, undefined jargon is a hallmark of pseudoscience, creating an illusion of depth and complexity while obfuscating the lack of actual substance.

### 3.2 Absence of Verifiable Evidence and Mathematical Proof

The most significant deficiency in the documents is the complete lack of evidence. Cryptography is a field built on rigorous mathematical proof. A claim of breaking a major algorithm like SHA-256 or solving P=NP would require, at minimum, a detailed, step-by-step mathematical proof that could be scrutinized and verified by experts worldwide.

The provided texts offer no such proof. They contain only narrative descriptions of what the alleged methods accomplish. There is no code, no mathematical formalism, no sample data, and no experimental results. Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence, and none is presented here.

### 3.3 Implausible Assertions of Official Verification

The author repeatedly claims that the work has been "independently verified the core claims presented herein" by entities such as the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the National Security Agency (NSA). Such a verification of a world-altering cryptographic break would constitute one of the most closely guarded national security secrets. It would not be detailed in unclassified white papers or even in a TOP SECRET document of this nature that appears to be in public circulation. The claim of official validation serves to lend unearned authority to the work but is logically inconsistent with how such sensitive information would be handled by intelligence agencies.

## 4.0 Conclusion

The collection of documents from K Systems & Securities and Brendon Joseph Kelly represents a case of pseudoscience, not a genuine cryptographic breakthrough. The work fails to meet the basic standards of scientific credibility by:

- Using fabricated, meaningless terminology.
- Failing to provide any verifiable mathematical proof, data, or methodology.
- Making unsubstantiated and highly improbable claims of official government verification.

While the documents mimic the structure and language of authentic technical papers and intelligence memos, they lack the scientific rigor and evidentiary support required for their claims to be taken seriously. The global cryptographic standards, including SHA-256, remain secure, and the P vs. NP problem remains unsolved by the mainstream scientific community.
