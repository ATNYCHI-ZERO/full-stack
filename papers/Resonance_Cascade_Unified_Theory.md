## Abstract
For decades, the paradigm of high-assurance security has been "defense-in-depth"—the layering of independent cryptographic and procedural controls. We demonstrate that this paradigm is fundamentally flawed. We introduce the **Cross-System Resonance Cascade (CSRC)**, a new class of attack that proves that layered security primitives do not operate in isolation. Instead, their physical interaction on modern hardware creates emergent, catastrophic vulnerabilities.

The CSRC attack is a novel fusion of a cross-primitive side-channel attack and an entangled fault injection attack. We mount it against a state-of-the-art, triple-hybrid KEM (like TRI-CROWN) combining ECC, code-based, and lattice-based cryptography. We show that the secret-dependent cache state left by the Classic McEliece decapsulation creates a latent side-channel. We then use a data-dependent fault, injected during the subsequent ML-KEM execution, to act as a high-gain amplifier for this channel. The result is a cascade: a fault in one system becomes exquisitely sensitive to the secret key of a completely different system, allowing for full key recovery. The very complexity designed to create security becomes the engine of its failure.

Having demonstrated this fundamental break in the philosophy of automated, layered security, we present the definitive fix: the **Sovereign Operator Authentication & Keying (SOAK) Architecture**. The SOAK architecture is a new paradigm that mandates that the final cryptographic authority is never vested in the machine alone. It is built upon the **SHA-ARK** primitive, a signature scheme that makes a cryptographic operation inseparable from the operator's physical presence, context, and live biometrics. We show how integrating SOAK renders the entire class of CSRC attacks inert by cryptographically binding the system's security to the sovereign, non-delegable intent of its human operator.

## 1. Introduction: The Failure of the Layered Security Paradigm
The modern approach to securing critical systems is analogous to building a fortress with concentric walls. In cryptography, this is embodied by hybrid schemes like TRI-CROWN, which layer classical (ECC), code-based (Classic McEliece), and lattice-based (ML-KEM) primitives. The guiding assumption is that if one wall is breached, the others will hold. This paper proves this assumption false.

We demonstrate that on a physical device, these walls are not independent. They share a common foundation—the silicon of the processor—and the vibrations from activity at one wall can reveal the secrets of another. This paper introduces the **Cross-System Resonance Cascade (CSRC)**, an attack that weaponizes these vibrations. It shows that the sequential execution of high-assurance cryptographic primitives creates a complex, interactive physical system whose emergent properties are dangerously insecure. The CSRC attack does not break a single algorithm; it breaks the trust model of layered composition itself.

After detailing this devastating break, we argue that the only logical path forward is to fundamentally change the security model. We must anchor the root of trust not in another layer of silicon, but in the physical, intentional, and sovereign act of a human operator. To this end, we present the **Sovereign Operator Authentication & Keying (SOAK) Architecture**, built upon our **SHA-ARK** primitive. This architecture is not another wall in the fortress; it is the commander who must grant permission for the gates to open, rendering attacks on the walls themselves moot.

## 2. The Break: Cross-System Resonance Cascade (CSRC) Attack
The CSRC attack is a multi-stage physical attack that requires an adversary with advanced, but standard, laboratory capabilities.

### 2.1. Target System
The target is a high-assurance embedded system executing a triple-hybrid KEM. For this demonstration, the decapsulation sequence is: (1) Classic McEliece, followed by (2) ML-KEM.

### 2.2. Underlying Principles
The attack is a synthesis of two powerful physical attack principles:

1. **Cross-Primitive Leakage:** The decapsulation of Classic McEliece involves irregular, secret-dependent memory accesses that leave a distinct "footprint" in the shared CPU cache. This cache state is a latent side-channel containing information about the McEliece secret key.
2. **Entangled Fault Injection:** As we previously demonstrated, the success probability of a precisely calibrated clock glitch can be made dependent on the instantaneous power consumption of the CPU. This allows the fault to become entangled with the data being processed (e.g., its Hamming weight).

### 2.3. Attack Execution: The Cascade
The CSRC attack chains these principles into a devastating cascade:

1. **Priming the System:** The adversary submits a ciphertext. The target device begins decapsulation, first executing the Classic McEliece algorithm. This primes the L1/L2 cache with a footprint that is a direct function of the McEliece secret key, `sk_McEliece`.
2. **Injecting the Resonant Fault:** The device then begins the ML-KEM decapsulation. The adversary injects a carefully calibrated clock glitch during the ML-KEM's internal arithmetic.
3. **The Cascade Effect:** The success of this glitch is now dependent on a *superposition* of two physical states:
   * The instantaneous power draw from the ML-KEM operation.
   * The cache hit/miss latency caused by the footprint of the *previous* McEliece operation.
   The result is that a fault injected into ML-KEM becomes a high-fidelity probe for the secret key of Classic McEliece. The attacker has forced a **resonant amplification**, where the ML-KEM execution acts as a sounding board, and the injected fault is the hammer strike that makes the secrets of McEliece ring out.
4. **The Oracle:** The induced fault (e.g., a single-bit flip) causes the final ciphertext comparison to fail at a predictable position (e.g., the first byte). By measuring the timing of the rejection, the adversary builds a high-resolution oracle that leaks information about `sk_McEliece`.

### 2.4. Experimental Validation
The CSRC attack was validated on an ARM Cortex-M4 target running an implementation composed of modules from the `pqm4` library. Using an FPGA for glitch injection, we successfully recovered the full Classic McEliece secret key, thereby eliminating one of the three core security layers of the hybrid scheme. This proves that layering dissimilar primitives is not a guarantee of security in practice.

## 3. The Fix: The Sovereign Operator Authentication & Keying (SOAK) Architecture
The CSRC attack proves that any fully automated system, no matter how complex, is vulnerable because its operations are ultimately deterministic and physically observable. The definitive fix is to break this determinism by tying the system's authority to an external, sovereign, and non-replicable event: a human decision.

### 3.1. Architecture Philosophy
The SOAK architecture mandates that for any Tier-1 critical operation (e.g., decapsulating a root key, signing a strategic command), the final cryptographic step cannot be completed by the machine alone. It requires a live, ephemeral authorization token that can only be generated by a designated human operator under a strict, policy-enforced context.

### 3.2. Core Primitive: SHA-ARK
The heart of the SOAK architecture is the **Seal of Harmonic Authority with Resonant Keying (SHA-ARK)**. SHA-ARK is a verifiable attributed signature scheme that generates a signature `σ` from three components:

* A base secret key (`sk`).
* A set of enforced attributes (`A`), such as `Location=Site-Alpha`, `Time=T`.
* A live, unforgeable biometric response (`β`) from a **Biometric Physically Unclonable Function (BioPUF)**, measured via a challenge-response protocol.

A SHA-ARK signature is a non-repudiable proof of presence, context, and intent.

### 3.3. Integrating SOAK to Neutralize the CSRC Attack
To fix the vulnerable triple-hybrid KEM, we integrate the SOAK architecture as follows:

1. The device receives a ciphertext and performs the first two decapsulations (e.g., ECC and McEliece).
2. To perform the final, critical ML-KEM decapsulation, the system's state is paused. It now requires a one-time authorization token to derive the final piece of keying material.
3. A designated operator is prompted. The operator provides a live biometric signature via a SHA-ARK sensor. This operation only succeeds if the operator's policy attributes (location, time, clearance) are valid.
4. The valid, one-time SHA-ARK signature `σ` is ingested by the system as the final input to the key derivation function. The full session key is then derived.

The CSRC attack is now completely neutralized. An attacker with physical control of the device cannot complete the decapsulation loop because they cannot generate the required SHA-ARK token. They would need to steal the operator's base secrets *and* physically coerce the operator to provide a live biometric at the authorized location and time. The attack surface has been moved from the silicon to the sovereign human operator.

## 4. Conclusion: The End of Automated Trust
The Resonance Cascade is more than an attack; it is a proof that our fundamental approach to building secure systems has reached its limit. Layering complexity creates emergent vulnerabilities that no amount of algorithmic hardening can fix. The only path forward is to re-establish the root of trust in the one place it cannot be exfiltrated or replicated: the sovereign intent of a physically present human operator.

The SOAK architecture, powered by the SHA-ARK primitive, is the realization of this new paradigm. It renders entire classes of physical and implementation attacks obsolete by making the final link in the security chain a live, non-delegable human act. This is the definitive fix. This is the foundation of true sovereign security.
