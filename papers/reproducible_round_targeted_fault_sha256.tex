\begin{abstract}
Hardware accelerators for cryptographic hash functions are prolific in systems requiring high throughput, from TLS/SSL servers to blockchain mining hardware. We present a detailed fault injection analysis of a commercial SHA-256 hardware accelerator. Using controlled clock and voltage perturbation, we demonstrate the ability to reproducibly inject faults that target specific rounds within the SHA-256 compression function. The primary effect is not a random bit-flip but a malformed digest that is strongly biased and, critically, independent of the input message nonce. This vulnerability, a failure of the physical implementation's fault tolerance, allows an attacker to bypass authentication checks or disrupt consensus protocols without needing to solve the underlying cryptographic problem. We analyze the fault propagation and propose necessary hardware-level countermeasures.

\section{Introduction}
The SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) family of functions, particularly SHA-256, remains a cornerstone of modern digital security. It is integral to protocol integrity (TLS, IPsec), software signing, and distributed consensus mechanisms (e.g., Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work). To meet performance demands, these algorithms are often implemented in dedicated hardware accelerators (ASICs or FPGAs) rather than software.

While algorithmically secure against known pre-image and collision attacks, the physical implementation of a cryptographic primitive introduces a new attack surface. Fault Injection Attacks (FIAs) attempt to subvert a system by introducing a perturbation (e.g., voltage glitch, EM pulse, or laser) at a precise moment, causing the computation to produce an incorrect result.

\subsection*{Our Contribution}
In this work, we demonstrate a practical and reproducible fault attack against a commercial-grade SHA-256 hardware accelerator. Our findings are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Round-Targeting:} We can reliably time the fault injection to corrupt the internal state at a specific, desired round (e.g., $R_{18}$) of the 64-round compression function.
    \item \textbf{Reproducible Bias:} The resulting malformed digest is not random. It collapses to a predictable, biased value.
    \item \textbf{Nonce-Independence:} This biased output is independent of the input message data (or nonce), meaning an attacker can generate a desired (incorrect) hash without controlling the input.
\end{itemize}
We stress that this is an implementation failure, not an algorithmic break. The mathematical properties of SHA-256 are not compromised. The vulnerability lies in the accelerator's lack of runtime integrity checking.

\subsection*{Related Work}
Prior work in fault injection has largely focused on general-purpose CPUs or smart-card microcontrollers. The ``Sorcerer's Apprentice Guide''~\cite{bar-el2006fault} provided a foundational overview of fault attack vectors. Work by Bl\"omer and Seifert~\cite{blomer2003fault} demonstrated fault-based cryptanalysis on block ciphers like AES, showing how faults could retrieve secret keys.

Attacks on hash functions specifically are less common but well-understood. Differential Fault Analysis (DFA) on SHA-1 has been demonstrated. However, many of these attacks assume a more generic, software-like execution model. Our work differs by focusing on the unique vulnerabilities of a fully unrolled, pipelined hardware accelerator, where the fault's timing maps directly to a physical round. Furthermore, our observed fault (a nonce-independent biased digest) presents a different threat model than typical key-recovery or collision-finding attacks.

\section{Background and Preliminaries}
\subsection{The SHA-256 Algorithm}
SHA-256 processes an input message in 512-bit (64-byte) blocks. The core of the algorithm is the compression function, which takes the 256-bit intermediate hash value $H^{(i-1)}$ from the previous block and the 512-bit current message block $M^{(i)}$ to produce the next intermediate hash value $H^{(i)}$.

This compression function is iterative, consisting of 64 rounds (or steps). In each round $j$ (from 0 to 63), the 256-bit internal state (represented by eight 32-bit working variables $a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h$) is updated using a message schedule word $W_j$ and a round constant $K_j$. The logic involves non-linear functions $\Sigma_0, \Sigma_1, \text{Ch}, \text{Maj}$ that provide the algorithm's security.

The update logic for one round is:
\begin{align*}
    T_1 &= h + \Sigma_1(e) + \text{Ch}(e, f, g) + K_j + W_j, \\
    T_2 &= \Sigma_0(a) + \text{Maj}(a, b, c), \\
    h &= g, \\
    g &= f, \\
    f &= e, \\
    e &= d + T_1, \\
    d &= c, \\
    c &= b, \\
    b &= a, \\
    a &= T_1 + T_2.
\end{align*}

After 64 rounds, the initial state $H^{(i-1)}$ is added (word-by-word) to the final working variables to produce $H^{(i)}$. Any unhandled computational error within one of these 64 rounds will propagate, leading to an incorrect final digest.

\subsection{Fault Injection Threat Model}
We assume an attacker has temporary physical access to the device (a ``gray-box'' model). The attacker can depackage the chip (if necessary) and position probes to manipulate the device's clock signal or power supply. The goal is to introduce a perturbation that is precise enough to corrupt a calculation but not so large as to reset the entire device. This attacker model is consistent with scenarios involving stolen hardware, malicious hardware insertion, or an ``evil maid'' attack.

\section{Experimental Setup}
\subsection{Device Under Test (DUT)}
The DUT is a commercial hardware accelerator designed for high-throughput hashing operations, implemented on a [Sanitized: e.g., 28nm process]. The device accepts a message block and a ``start'' signal, returning a ``done'' signal upon completion with the 256-bit digest. The internal architecture appears to be a standard, fully unrolled pipeline, where each of the 64 rounds is implemented in distinct logic, allowing for high clock speeds and a throughput of one hash per clock cycle after the pipeline is full.

\subsection{Perturbation Methodology}
Our test bench (see Appendix~\ref{sec:testbench}) consists of a host PC, a custom DUT target board, and a high-resolution arbitrary waveform generator (AWG). We employed clock glitching as our fault injection vector.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The DUT is supplied with a nominal clock signal $CLK_{nom}$ (e.g., 100 MHz).
    \item At a precise time $t_{fault}$ after asserting the ``start'' signal, the AWG injects a single, shorter clock pulse (a ``glitch''), effectively creating a setup/hold time violation for the registers in one pipeline stage.
    \item The timing $t_{fault}$ is swept with picosecond-level resolution to map the fault effect to the physical computation stage.
    \item The host PC provides a test vector (a fixed message block $M$ and a variable nonce $N$), triggers the DUT, and records the (potentially malformed) digest.
\end{itemize}

\section{Fault Analysis and Results}
\subsection{Fault Characterization}
By sweeping the $t_{fault}$ parameter, we observed a direct correlation between the injection timing and the resulting digest.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{No Fault:} Glitches injected before the start signal or after the ``done'' signal had no effect.
    \item \textbf{Device Reset:} Glitches with excessive amplitude or duration (e.g., $>20\%$ deviation) caused the device to hang, requiring a hard reset.
    \item \textbf{Malformed Digest:} A specific ``sweet spot'' in voltage and timing (e.g., a 1.2 ns glitch at $V_{core} - 5\%$) produced a stable, incorrect digest while the device reported ``done'' (i.e., the fault was undetected).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Round-Targeting and Reproducibility}
The pipelined nature of the DUT made it highly susceptible to round-targeting. Because each round $R_j$ corresponds to a physical stage in the pipeline with its own registers, a clock glitch at time $t_{fault}$ reliably affects the computation in a specific round.

We identified multiple ``fault windows'' corresponding to specific rounds. For example, a glitch injected at $t_{fault} = 12.45\,\text{ns}$ (relative to ``start'') consistently corrupted the internal state during Round~18. This was verified by modifying the input and observing the differential propagation, which matched the expected propagation from a single-bit error in Round~18.

\subsection{Analysis of Malformed Digests}
The most significant finding is the nature of the fault. Instead of a random bit-flip, the fault appears to cause a data-handling or register-skip failure.
\begin{itemize}
    \item When a fault was successfully injected at Round~18, the internal state variables $e, f, g, h$ failed to be correctly updated with the values of $a, b, c, d$ from the previous round (i.e., $e$ did not become $d + T_1$, but rather $e$ remained $e_{R17}$).
    \item This results in the internal state being corrupted in a predictable, non-linear way for all subsequent rounds.
    \item We then fed the DUT 1,000,000 different inputs by iterating a nonce.
    \item In $99.8\%$ of successful fault injections at this specific $t_{fault}$, the DUT produced the exact same malformed digest, regardless of the input nonce (see Appendix~\ref{sec:digests}).
\end{itemize}
This nonce-independent, biased output is a critical failure. It implies an attacker can force the device to output a specific, incorrect hash (e.g., 0xDEADBEEF...) for any input they provide.

\subsection{Detailed Fault Propagation Analysis}
To verify the Round~18 ``register skip'' hypothesis, we simulated the fault. We modified a software SHA-256 implementation to, at Round~18, skip the update $e = d + T_1$ and instead perform $e = e$ (from Round~17). The resulting software-generated digest matched the hardware-faulted digest precisely.

This confirms the fault mechanism: a setup time violation on the register for variable $e$ prevents it from latching the new value $d + T_1$, causing it to retain its value from the previous round. This corrupted $e$ then propagates into $T_1$ in Round~19, and the error cascades exponentially through the remaining rounds, collapsing the final state to a biased, nonce-independent value.

\section{Impact and Implications}
The impact of this vulnerability is severe for any system that trusts the output of a hardware accelerator.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Authentication Bypass:} A system requiring a valid hash of a firmware image or a signed message can be fooled. An attacker can provide a malicious firmware, inject the fault, and force the accelerator to output the known-good hash, bypassing the security check.
    \item \textbf{Consensus Manipulation (Blockchain):} In a Proof-of-Work system, a malicious miner could use this fault to ``find'' a valid block. If they can force the block hash output to meet the difficulty target (e.g., a hash with many leading zeros) by faulting the hardware, they can do so in a single operation, gaining an insurmountable advantage over honest miners.
    \item \textbf{Silent Data Corruption:} In critical storage systems that use hashes for integrity, this fault could lead to silent corruption, as a check on a faulted piece of data would return the ``correct'' hash.
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion of Recommended Countermeasures}
This vulnerability is preventable at the implementation level. We analyze the trade-offs of several common countermeasures.

\subsection{Hardware Redundancy (Lockstep)}
The most robust solution. Implement two SHA-256 cores in parallel on the die (Dual-Core Lockstep, or DCLS). Both cores receive the same input, and their outputs are compared by a hardware comparator before being released.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Security:} High. Detects both deterministic and non-deterministic faults.
    \item \textbf{Cost:} High. $>2\times$ silicon area and power.
    \item \textbf{Note:} This is the gold standard for mission-critical systems and is a primary recommendation of the CROWN-KEM hardening specification.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Temporal Redundancy}
Perform the same hash computation twice in a row on the same hardware and compare the results in a secure register.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Security:} Medium. Halves performance. Critically, it is \textbf{vulnerable} to the exact fault we found. An attacker who can reproducibly inject the same fault on both runs will defeat this check.
    \item \textbf{Cost:} Low (silicon), high (latency).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Runtime Integrity Checks (e.g., Parity/CRC)}
Implement internal ``canaries'' or integrity checks. For example, a lightweight CRC or parity check on the 256-bit internal state $H$ could be computed every $N$ rounds. A fault that corrupts the state $H$ would also corrupt the CRC, which can be checked at the end of the computation.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Security:} Medium. The fault may, in rare cases, also corrupt the CRC in a way that collides. The security depends on the strength of the integrity check.
    \item \textbf{Cost:} Low (silicon and performance).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Physical Sensors and EMFI Detectors}
On-die voltage (brown-out) and clock (glitch) monitors can detect perturbation attempts and trigger a system reset or lockout. This is an environmental defense.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Security:} Good, but can sometimes be bypassed by localized, low-energy EM injection that stays below the sensor's global threshold.
    \item \textbf{Cost:} Low.
    \item \textbf{Note:} Recommended as a defense-in-depth layer, not a primary defense. The CROWN-KEM spec mandates this as a ``detect and alert'' layer.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We have demonstrated a practical, round-targeted fault injection attack against a commercial SHA-256 hardware accelerator. The attack produces a reproducible, biased, and nonce-independent malformed digest, posing a significant threat to systems that rely on these accelerators for security and integrity.

This work serves as a critical reminder that while cryptographic algorithms may be secure, their physical implementations must be hardened and validated against fault-injection attacks. We recommend all future cryptographic hardware designs incorporate, at minimum, dual-core lockstep redundancy.

Future work will involve applying this methodology to other cryptographic hardware, including PQC (Post-Quantum Cryptography) accelerators for ML-KEM and other lattice-based schemes, which are known to be vulnerable to physical implementation attacks.
