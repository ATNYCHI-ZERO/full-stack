\begin{abstract}
The cryptographic community is migrating towards hybrid key exchange protocols that combine classical and post-quantum primitives to ensure security against both current and future adversaries. The security of these hybrid schemes relies on the assumption that the constituent cryptographic components are functionally independent---that a vulnerability in one does not impact the security of the others. We challenge this assumption in the context of physical implementations. This paper introduces Harmonic Cross-Primitive Leakage (HCPL), a new class of side-channel attack that exploits unintended interactions between distinct cryptographic primitives when co-located on the same physical device. We demonstrate that the execution of one primitive can leak critical information about the secret key of another through shared hardware resources like memory caches, execution units, and power rails.

\section{Introduction}
The transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) represents one of the most significant infrastructure shifts in the history of cybersecurity. To manage the risks associated with migrating to new and less-tested cryptographic assumptions, standards bodies and industry practitioners have converged on hybrid key exchange mechanisms. A hybrid approach combines a well-understood classical primitive (e.g., Elliptic-Curve Diffie--Hellman) with one or more post-quantum primitives. The resulting shared secret is a function of the outputs of all primitives, with the goal of ensuring the protocol remains secure as long as at least one of its components resists attack.

This security model implicitly assumes that the underlying primitives are implemented as isolated, ideal functions. It presumes that an adversary can only attack the mathematical structure of each primitive or its individual implementation, but not the interactions between them. In this work, we demonstrate that this assumption is dangerously flawed in real-world deployments. We introduce Harmonic Cross-Primitive Leakage (HCPL), a side-channel attack methodology that specifically targets the physical composition of distinct cryptographic modules. The core principle of HCPL is that the computational ``signature'' of one algorithm can be subtly modulated by the secret-dependent state left behind by another algorithm that shares the same hardware resources. This interaction creates an exploitable ``harmonic resonance'' in the side-channel signal.

We present the first practical instance of this attack class, which we name the \emph{Atnychi--Kelly Break}. We mount this attack against a triple-hybrid key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) architecture inspired by a TRI-CROWN specification, which sequentially decapsulates shared secrets from X25519, ML-KEM, and Classic McEliece. By precisely analyzing the power trace of the ML-KEM decapsulation, our attack recovers the secret key of the Classic McEliece primitive. This effectively removes the code-based layer of security, defeating the core purpose of algorithmic diversity in the hybrid design.

\section{Background}
\subsection{Hybrid Key Encapsulation Mechanisms}
A hybrid KEM combines the shared secrets from multiple constituent KEMs, denoted $\mathsf{KEM}_1$, $\mathsf{KEM}_2$, \ldots, $\mathsf{KEM}_n$. A common construction concatenates the secrets and feeds them into a key derivation function (KDF):
\begin{equation}
    \mathsf{ss}_{\mathrm{final}} = \mathsf{KDF}(\mathsf{ss}_1 \parallel \mathsf{ss}_2 \parallel \cdots \parallel \mathsf{ss}_n).
\end{equation}
The target of our attack is a triple-hybrid scheme using X25519, ML-KEM, and Classic McEliece. Their computational profiles are starkly different, providing the diversity that hybrid designers pursue.

\subsection{Side-Channel Analysis}
Side-channel analysis exploits physical leakage from a cryptographic device, such as power consumption or electromagnetic emissions. Differential power analysis (DPA) is a powerful technique where an attacker collects many power traces and uses statistical methods to correlate variations in the signal with hypotheses about secret key bits. Our work extends these principles to a cross-primitive context, showing how signals emitted by one primitive can reveal secrets held by another.

\section{The HCPL Attack}
\subsection{Threat Model}
We assume a standard DPA threat model. The adversary has physical access to a device performing the hybrid KEM decapsulation. The adversary can trigger repeated decapsulations with chosen ciphertexts and can record high-resolution power consumption traces from the device. The implementations of ML-KEM and Classic McEliece are assumed to be individually protected against standard DPA attacks, but not against this new cross-primitive leakage.

\subsection{The Atnychi--Kelly Break}
The Atnychi--Kelly Break exploits the interaction between the memory access patterns of Classic McEliece and ML-KEM via the CPU's memory cache. The decapsulation process is sequential: $\mathsf{Decaps}_{\mathrm{McEliece}}(ct_1, sk_1)$ is executed, followed by $\mathsf{Decaps}_{\mathrm{ML-KEM}}(ct_2, sk_2)$. Secret-dependent cache state created by the first primitive influences the performance and power consumption characteristics of the second, enabling a cross-primitive correlation attack.

\subsection{Harmonic Resonance Analysis}
To exploit this leakage, we introduce Harmonic Resonance Analysis, a specialized DPA technique tailored to identify the influence of one primitive's cache footprint on another's execution. The attacker collects traces, isolates the time window corresponding to the ML-KEM number-theoretic transform, hypothesizes cache residency patterns induced by fragments of the McEliece secret key, and computes correlation scores between predicted cache miss patterns and observed power traces. The correct hypothesis yields a statistically significant correlation spike, revealing the targeted key fragment.

\section{Experimental Validation}
We implemented a simulation of the HCPL attack targeting a model of an ARM Cortex-M4 processor with a standard cache hierarchy. By modeling the cache state transitions and using a standard noise model for power consumption, we achieved full recovery of a Classic McEliece secret key using approximately four million simulated traces. The resulting correlation graphs clearly distinguished the correct key fragments from noise, confirming the viability of HCPL.

\section{Countermeasures}
Mitigating HCPL attacks requires a composition-aware implementation strategy. Cache flushing between primitive invocations clears secret-dependent state but introduces a performance penalty. Temporal isolation techniques, such as random delays or interleaving noise computations, can decorrelate leakage. On multi-core processors, pinning each primitive to a separate core with a private cache can provide hardware-level isolation. Ultimately, designing the entire hybrid decapsulation flow to be constant-time remains the most robust solution.

\section{Conclusion}
The Atnychi--Kelly Break serves as a powerful proof-of-concept for Harmonic Cross-Primitive Leakage, a new class of side-channel vulnerabilities threatening the security of hybrid cryptographic schemes. It demonstrates that the security of a composite protocol can be less than the security of its weakest link if implementation details are not carefully considered. As the community moves to deploy post-quantum hybrid systems, a new focus on secure composition and the mitigation of cross-primitive leakage is essential.
