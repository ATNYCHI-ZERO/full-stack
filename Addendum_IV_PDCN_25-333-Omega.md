SUBJECT:
Final, Binding Terms of Engagement Under PDCN 25‑333‑Ω (“Protective Oversight Directive”)

Protective Oversight Directive, PDCN 25‑333‑Ω

ARTICLE 1 | INTRODUCTION & CONTRACTUAL INTEGRATION

1.1 Supersession.
This Addendum IV supersedes and nullifies all prior drafts, proposals, or communications (oral or written) regarding the subject matter herein.

1.2 Intent of Finality.
These terms are presented as final, non‑negotiable, and binding upon formal acceptance. This document is not a preliminary draft but the conclusive instrument of engagement between the Principal and the United States Government (the “Government”).

1.3 Authority & Enforceability Disclaimer.
Acceptance and enforcement of these terms shall be subject to lawful authority, applicable appropriations, and conformity with controlling statutes (including but not limited to Title 10 U.S.C., Title 48 C.F.R., the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and relevant provisions of the National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAA)).

ARTICLE 2 | CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO GOVERNMENT OBLIGATION

2.1 Term A — Engagement Fee (Good‑Faith Consideration).

The Government shall pay a non‑refundable, unconditional engagement fee of USD 5,000,000.00 (“Fee”) by federal wire transfer of “clean funds” to the Principal’s designated banking institution (Mercury Bank, per Treasury on‑file account) within seventy‑two (72) hours after the date this Addendum is formally registered by OUSDI&S.

The Fee is not a loan, credit, or advance but a binding condition precedent. Its payment shall constitute the Government’s explicit, irrevocable acknowledgment of the Principal’s demands.

The Principal shall, upon receipt of cleared funds, certify in writing to the responsible contracting authority that the Fee is accepted, triggering the operative obligations of the Government under this Addendum.

2.2 Term B — Legal Expungement & Restoration.

Within twenty‑four (24) hours following registration, the Government must execute all necessary executive, judicial, and administrative measures to cause complete expungement or sealing of all criminal, civil, or administrative records (federal, state, local) involving the following individuals:
a. Brendon Joseph Kelly
b. Korre Fuller
c. Christopher Michael Cervantez

The expungement must include deletion or anonymization from all electronic and physical databases (e.g., NCIC, CJIS), sealing of court files, and full restoration of civil rights (including firearms rights). The Department of Justice shall issue formal “Letters of Clearance” confirming no outstanding legal impediments.

2.3 Term C — Biphasic Valuation & Settlement Framework.

2.3.1 Phase 1 — Intellectual Property Valuation (eighteen [18] months).

Upon execution of Term A and Term B, a joint valuation committee (comprising representatives from the Government, including NIST, DoD, Treasury, and counsel for the Principal) plus mutually agreed independent auditors shall conduct a good‑faith valuation of the technology “K Math” and all derivatives, incorporating military, economic, intelligence, and strategic value.

The process must conform to accepted IP valuation methodologies (e.g., discounted cash flow, income approach, comparable transactions) and relevant Government IP valuation standards (e.g., as encouraged under NDAA Section 801 pilot programs).

The joint committee must settle on a final valuation figure no later than 18 months from the registration date.

2.3.2 Phase 2 — Settlement & Title Transfer (six [6] months).

Within six months after final valuation, the Government shall effect all required legal, financial, contractual, and trust instruments to deliver compensation to the Principal.

The settlement shall include a heritable royalty structure, per Term F, and any conversion of rights, equities, or titles as necessary to effect full transfer or licensing.

2.4 Term D — Material Breach & Default Consequences.

Any failure by the Government to satisfy the timelines or obligations in Terms 2.1, 2.2, or either phase of 2.3 shall constitute a material breach, rendering the entire agreement void ab initio.

Upon breach, the Principal shall be freed from any exclusivity, non‑disclosure, or national security constraints, and may license, assign, or transfer the intellectual property to any foreign or commercial entity, as determined in his sole discretion.

2.5 Term E — Immediate Operational & Security Provisions.

Within 72 hours of registration, the Government shall provide:
(a) Strategic Ally designation, codified via classified presidential finding granting operational immunity short of felony offenses;
(b) Secure infrastructure: issuance of encrypted, militarily accredited hardware and communications systems, guaranteed free from U.S. agency surveillance;
(c) High‑level liaison: assignment of a GS‑15 or O‑6 ranked official with authority to resolve interagency disputes;
(d) Protective detail: U.S. Marshals SOG (Special Operations Group) protection for the Principal, designees, and immediate family, with operational precedence over normal protocols.

2.6 Term F — Royalty & Attribution Legacy Mandate.

Any settlement shall include a perpetual, heritable royalty (no less than 10 %) on net revenues generated by “K Math” derivatives, payable to the Principal’s lineage.

All derivative technology shall bear a permanent “Powered by K Systems” attribution in any disseminated product, interface, or documentation. This term is non‑waivable and non‑negotiable.

ARTICLE 3 | LEGAL & REGULATORY CONFORMITY

3.1 Incorporation of Federal Acquisition Law.

This Addendum and any implementing contracts or instruments shall comply with FAR (Title 48 C.F.R.) requirements, including competition, contract formation, clause insertion, and acquisition planning.

Because the Department of Defense is involved, DFARS and applicable agency supplements must be observed, especially concerning data rights and technical data.

Any deviation from mandatory FAR clauses must follow proper waiver or deviation procedures under FAR Subpart 1.4.

3.2 Statutory Authority & Appropriations.

All payments, performance obligations, and transfers are expressly subject to lawful authority and the availability of appropriated funds. No action here may contravene the Antideficiency Act or applicable appropriation ceilings.

The Government must effect internal legal approvals (e.g., contracting officer, legal counsel, appropriation certification) consistent with FAR Part 1 procedures.

3.3 Intellectual Property & Data Rights Compliance.

The valuation and transfer of IP must adhere to FAR Part 27 (Patents, Data, and Copyrights) and relevant DFARS sections (e.g., DFARS 227) regarding government rights, licensing, and use.

Any derivative works, technical data, or software shall be handled under negotiated licenses consistent with government purpose rights, restricted rights, or unlimited licensing, as permitted by law.

The valuation process shall align with existing DoD IP valuation guidance, including pilot programs under NDAA Section 801 and DoD’s IP evaluation frameworks.

3.4 NDAA & Oversight Provisions.

This agreement must respect constraints and opportunities under the applicable National Defense Authorization Act for the current fiscal year (e.g., supply chain rules, cybersecurity requirements, bid protest thresholds).

The Government must permit audits and oversight by GAO, DOD Inspector General, and congressional committees consistent with statutory authority.

No term here may conflict with NDAA provisions regarding competition, audit rights, or disclosure.

3.5 Dispute Resolution & Claims Handling.

Disputes arising under this Addendum or implementing instruments shall be resolved in accordance with the Contract Disputes Act (CDA) and the appeals process through the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals or Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals, as applicable.

The Government and Principal waive any claim of duress, coercion, or unilateral mistake upon acceptance via the payment in Term 2.1, except as legally recognized under federal law.

ARTICLE 4 | ACCEPTANCE, EFFECTIVE DATE & TERMINATION

4.1 Acceptance Mechanism.

The Government’s transfer of the Fee under Term 2.1 is the formal act of acceptance, binding it to all terms herein, subject to lawful authority and internal approvals.

4.2 Effective Date.

The effective date of this Addendum is the date on which OUSDI&S formally acknowledges and registers it. All subsequent deadlines and timelines flow from that registration date.

4.3 Voidance on Non‑Compliance.

Should the Government fail materially in any clause, this Addendum shall become void and of no legal force, except for the Principal’s rights to seek redress under applicable law.

4.4 Severability & Survivability.

If any term or provision is held invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the remaining terms shall remain in full force.

Provisions of royalty, attribution, dispute resolution, and compliance with FAR/DFARS shall survive expiration or termination.

ARTICLE 5 | MISCELLANEA

5.1 Notices & Communications.

All notices hereunder shall be in writing, delivered to the designated contracting officers, counsel, and the Principal via certified channels.

5.2 Entire Agreement.

This Addendum, together with any implementing contract, annex, or trust agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning this subject matter and supersedes all prior understandings.

5.3 Amendment Restriction.

No change or waiver of this Addendum shall be effective unless in writing and signed by properly authorized representatives of both parties.

5.4 Counterparts; Classified Handling.

This Addendum may be executed in counterparts. Classified or restricted portions shall be handled per Government security protocols.
