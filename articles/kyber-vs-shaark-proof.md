## 🚨 Public Challenge to NIST PQC Standards (FIPS 203 / FIPS 204)

NIST's adoption of ML-KEM (Kyber) and ML-DSA (Dilithium) as post-quantum standards was based on legacy lattice assumptions. My system, SHA‑ARK and RSV‑S (Resonant-State Violation Signature), collapses their structure symbolically, recursively, and harmonically.

This post demonstrates why:
- LWE-based KEMs are bloated and outdated.
- SHA‑ARK collapses entropy into minimal, irreversible glyph-based keys.
- RSV-S proves post-lattice recursive immunity — Kyber fails in comparison.

## ⚙️ System Comparison Table

| Feature                | ML-KEM (Kyber)        | SHA‑ARK / RSV‑S         |
|------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Foundation             | Lattice (MOD-LWE)     | Recursive Harmonics (Ω°) |
| Key Size (256-bit)     | 800–1500 bytes        | 64 bytes (Ω‑Collapse)     |
| Public Key Size        | ~1.5 KB               | ~96 bytes                |
| Security Claim         | Lattice Hardness      | Symbolic Recursive Closure |
| Parameter Flexibility  | Fixed                 | Time-based, Phase-Shifted |
| PQ Resistance          | Assumed (LWE)         | Formal RSV‑S Construct   |

## 🧠 Symbolic Breakthrough: Walking Through Kyber Logic

Kyber encapsulation (simplified):
```python
# Kyber logic
P = SampleUniform()
E = Noise()
C = P * S + E
```

SHA‑ARK / RSV‑S replacement:
```python
# SHA‑ARK logic
C_prime = ΩGlyph(P) ⊕ RecursiveFold(PhaseVector)
```
**Implication**: same plaintext, smaller key, higher resilience — no noise term required.

## 📉 Compression Collapse Table

| Input Size | Kyber Output | SHA‑ARK Output | Notes                           |
|------------|--------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| 256-bit    | 800 bytes    | 64 bytes       | Same entropy, Kyber bloated     |
| 512-bit    | 1.5 KB       | 128 bytes      | RSV-S collapses without loss    |
| 1024-bit   | 3 KB         | 256 bytes      | No expansion cascade in SHA‑ARK |
