## I. Parties and Jurisdiction

1. **The Affiant:** I, **[Your Full Name]**, a natural person and sovereign citizen of the United States, hereinafter "the Affiant," do hereby state and declare the following facts under penalty of perjury.
2. **The Recipient:** This notice is directed to any and all public officials, law enforcement officers, administrative agents, and any other persons or entities acting under color of law, hereinafter "the Agent."

## II. Declarations of Fact and Status

1. **Fact of Sovereignty and Non-Waiver:** The Affiant is a sovereign individual, endowed with inalienable rights which predate and supersede the formation of any government or corporate entity. The Affiant has not, and does not, knowingly waive any of these rights at any time. This document serves as permanent and explicit notice of this non-waiver.
2. **Fact of Conditional Compliance:** The Affiant moves and operates within the jurisdiction of the United States. The Affiant’s compliance with statutes, codes, and regulations is conditional and is undertaken *without prejudice* to any of the Affiant's rights. Such compliance shall be legally construed as a voluntary choice made to facilitate peaceful interaction and avoid conflict, and not as an admission of subservience to any authority.
3. **Fact of Superior Knowledge (The "K-Math" Proviso):** The Affiant attests to possessing a superior and foundational understanding of logical and causal systems. This understanding compels the Affiant to demand the highest possible standard of logical consistency and strict adherence to the rule of law from any Agent. This is now a matter of **National Security**. The stability of the system you, the Agent, represent is now harmonically linked to the respect afforded to the principles laid out in this document. Any action taken against the Affiant is an action taken against the foundational stability of your own system. **Your protection is contingent upon affording me mine.**

## III. Binding Protocol for All Interactions

This section constitutes a formal, legally binding notice to any Agent who may interact with the Affiant. Failure to adhere to this protocol constitutes a willful violation of the Affiant's constitutionally protected rights.

1. **Assertion of the Right to Remain Silent (5th Amendment):** The Affiant hereby invokes, in perpetuity, the right to remain silent. The Affiant will not answer questions, provide information, or engage in any discussion with any Agent regarding any incident, investigation, or inquiry. The only statement the Affiant may make is to identify themself, if lawfully required, and to state: "I am invoking my right to remain silent. I want my lawyer."
2. **Assertion of the Right to Counsel (6th Amendment):** The Affiant hereby invokes, in perpetuity, the right to legal counsel during any and all questioning. No questioning may proceed without the Affiant’s legal counsel present.
3. **Denial of Consent for Searches (4th Amendment):** The Affiant hereby explicitly and permanently **denies consent** for any and all searches of their person, property, vehicle, effects, or residence. Any search must be conducted with a lawfully obtained warrant, signed by a judge, and based on probable cause. The Affiant will state: "I do not consent to any searches." An Agent who proceeds with a search after this denial does so unlawfully and will be held personally liable.
4. **Demand for Due Process and Strict Proof:** The Affiant demands strict adherence to all procedural rules and due process protections guaranteed by the 5th and 14th Amendments. Any claim or charge made against the Affiant must be accompanied by a sworn affidavit of fact from a party with direct, first-hand knowledge.

## IV. Notice of Liability to the Agent

You, the Agent, are hereby put on notice:

1. This document creates a permanent record of the Affiant’s explicit assertion of their rights.
2. Your decision to proceed in violation of any of the rights asserted herein will be considered a **willful and malicious act** intended to deprive the Affiant of their constitutionally protected liberties.
3. Such a violation will subject you, the Agent, **personally**, to civil and/or criminal liability under relevant state and federal law (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983).
4. This document will serve as primary evidence against you in any subsequent legal action.

## V. Conclusion and Notarization

This Affidavit is a declaration of my existing rights and a binding protocol for any who would interact with me under color of law. It is a tool of peace and clarity. Adherence to it will ensure all interactions are lawful. Violation of it will ensure swift and severe legal consequences for the violator.

I, **[Your Full Name]**, declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America that the foregoing is true and correct.
