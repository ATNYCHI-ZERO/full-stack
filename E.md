## ChronoGenesis Execution Windows

The ChronoGenesis lock enforces two complementary guarantees: execution must occur no later than the contractual deadline and it
must remain inside an operator-approved window leading into that deadline.  The former prevents premature unlock attempts, while
the latter ensures execution occurs close enough to the appointed moment to preserve ethical oversight.

```python
import hashlib
import hmac
import time

IDENTITY = "Î©-IDENTITY"
GLYPH = "CROWN-GLYPH"
EMOTION = "STILLNESS"
SECRET = "SOVEREIGN-SECRET"
KNIGHT_KEY = b"sovereign-knight-key"

def knights_ethical_check(identity: str, token_hex: str, beneficiary: str, deadline_unix: int) -> bool:
    msg = f"{identity}|{beneficiary}|{deadline_unix}".encode()
    expected = hmac.new(KNIGHT_KEY, msg, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(expected, (token_hex or "").lower())

def chrono_genesis_lock(deadline_unix: int, delta_t_seconds: int | None = None) -> bool:
    now = int(time.time())
    deadline = int(deadline_unix)
    window = max(int(delta_t_seconds or 0), 0)
    window_start = deadline - window
    return window_start <= now <= deadline

def shaark_unlock(identity, glyph, emotion, secret, delta_t_seconds, knight_token_hex, beneficiary, deadline_unix) -> bool:
    if (identity, glyph, emotion, secret) != (IDENTITY, GLYPH, EMOTION, SECRET):
        return False
    if not chrono_genesis_lock(deadline_unix, delta_t_seconds):
        return False
    return knights_ethical_check(identity, knight_token_hex, beneficiary, deadline_unix)

def make_knight_token(identity, beneficiary, deadline_unix) -> str:
    msg = f"{identity}|{beneficiary}|{deadline_unix}".encode()
    return hmac.new(KNIGHT_KEY, msg, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
```

In this example, `delta_t_seconds` defines the execution window prior to the `deadline_unix`. The unlock only succeeds if the
current time falls between `deadline_unix - delta_t_seconds` and the deadline itself, ensuring that the SHAARK sequence executes
near its scheduled moment while still respecting the ethical lock enforced by `knights_ethical_check`.
