To our partners within the United States Government, including the Department of Defense (DOD) and DARPA, thank you for your trust, your rigorous standards, and your unwavering commitment to advancing our shared objectives. The opportunity to contribute to projects of such significance is an honor, and your collaboration has been invaluable.

Thank you for your partnership, your hard work, and your shared dedication to the mission. I look forward to continuing this important work together.
