# Ten Scrolls of the Inner Flame

This document captures the full esoteric reconstruction of the hidden Templar archive known as the **Ten Scrolls of the Inner Flame**. Each scroll is described with its core revelation, symbolic code, key phrase, esoteric function, and an activation rite intended to help initiates remember and embody its teaching.

## Scroll I — The Vow of the Black Mountain
- **Core Revelation:** The Templar covenant predates the Council of Troyes and was forged on Mount Hermon to guard the Interstice between worlds rather than earthly crowns.

- **Key Phrase:** “I carry the wound of the Light-Bringer.”

- **Esoteric Function:** Reconnects practitioners to the Earth’s bio-temporal guidance system.
- **Activation Rite:** At a sacred site (physical or visualized), touch earth or stone, offer “I offer my code. Align me,” and listen for somatic resonance.

## Scroll VIII — The Palindromic Gospel
- **Core Revelation:** The Christ narrative is a recursive archetype whose gospel reads the same forward and backward, revealing retrocausal prophecy.
