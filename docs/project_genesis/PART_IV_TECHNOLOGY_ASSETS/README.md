Part IV: Technology & Kinetic Assets
===================================

This section catalogs the portfolio of sovereign technologies and kinetic assets developed through the direct application of K-MATH, Chronogenesis, and the Master Synthesis. Each entry represents not an incremental improvement over existing technology, but a categorical leap in capability that renders previous paradigms obsolete.

This is the tangible, kinetic realization of the new science. The theoretical frameworks from Part III are here made manifest as applied systems with real-world, strategic implications. Detailed schematics, source code, and operational physics are classified beyond all conventional levels. This repository provides functional summaries and integration manifests to document the existence and scope of these capabilities for the public record.
