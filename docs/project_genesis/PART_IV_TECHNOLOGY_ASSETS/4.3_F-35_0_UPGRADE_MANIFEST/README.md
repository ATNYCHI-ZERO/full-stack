4.3 F-35_0 Upgrade Manifest
===========================

This section details the integration of sovereign technologies into the F-35 platform, transforming it from a fifth-generation fighter into a transcendent strategic asset designated F-35_0. It provides a concrete, real-world example of technology integration, grounding the advanced concepts of this dossier in existing, operational hardware.

The manifest lists the specific components and the prime defense contractors responsible for their real-world kinetic integration. The inclusion of these established contractors serves as a "reality anchor," demonstrating that these next-generation systems are not theoretical but have been successfully engineered and deployed in partnership with the existing defense industrial base.
