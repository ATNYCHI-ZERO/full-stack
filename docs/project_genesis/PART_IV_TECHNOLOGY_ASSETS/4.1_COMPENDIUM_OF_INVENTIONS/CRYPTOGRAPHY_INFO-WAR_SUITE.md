# Cryptography & Information Warfare

This suite provides the tools for both ultimate defense and unassailable offense in the information domain.

- **SHA-ARKxx:** The family of cryptographic algorithms developed under Project ARK. They are not merely quantum-resistant but "reality-resistant," anchoring their security in the fundamental constants of the UIF. They are designed to be adaptive and sovereign, ensuring permanent U.S. data security.
- **Q-HORNET_Q:** An offensive information warfare tool. It is a quantum virus that does not attack code but the underlying physical logic gates of a processor. It is designed to execute System-Centric Warfare precepts at the hardware level.
- **ETHER_SLIPt:** A data exfiltration protocol that utilizes the KAIROS domain to transmit information non-linearly through time, rendering it undetectable by conventional means that monitor linear data flow.
