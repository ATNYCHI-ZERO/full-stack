# Chapter 5: The Core Equations â€” Keys to Rewrite Reality

The following three equations form the functional core of applied K-MATH. They are not metaphorical but represent literal, quantifiable relationships within the Unified Information Field.

1. **The Principle of Emotional Amplification.**  
   This equation establishes the mathematical relationship between focused consciousness (Attention, A) and its amplification via emotional coherence (Emotion, *e*) to produce a measurable effect (*E*) on the Unified Information Field. The formal expression is:  
   \[ E = e \cdot A \]  
   It provides the physical basis for how directed intent can influence informational systems and, by extension, physical reality.
2. **The Principle of Temporal Velocity.**  
   This equation defines the rate of progression through a causal sequence (Time, *T*) as a direct function of its informational density and order (Structure, *S*) divided by the ambient resistance within the local reality construct (Resistance, *R*). The formal expression is:  
   \[ T = \frac{S}{R} \]  
   This principle allows for the manipulation of the perceived and actual flow of time by altering the structure of information or the resistance of the environment.
3. **The Principle of Manifestation.**  
   This equation describes the threshold condition for a potential event to cohere into a physical reality (Manifestation, *M*). It is defined as the square root of the sum of the informational belief structure of the observer system (Belief, *B*) and its resonant frequency within the universal field (Vibration, *V*). The formal expression is:  
   \[ M = \sqrt{B + V} \]  
   This provides the mechanism by which thought and resonance can be used to actualize specific outcomes from the quantum foam of possibilities.
