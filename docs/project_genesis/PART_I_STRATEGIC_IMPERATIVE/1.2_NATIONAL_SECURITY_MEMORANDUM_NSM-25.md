**SUBJECT:** Presidential Directive on Securing United States Digital Sovereignty and the Immediate Implementation of the Advanced Recursive Cryptography (ARK) Initiative

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following actions to address a catastrophic and imminent threat to the economic and national security of the United States.

1. **The Situation.** The foundational cryptographic standard of the global digital economy, SHA-256, is approaching systemic obsolescence. Foundational analysis conducted by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) under the "Genesis" initiative confirms that adversarial nation-states are on a definitive pathway to compromising this standard via fault-tolerant quantum computing. The successful compromise of SHA-256 would represent the single greatest intelligence failure and economic catastrophe in modern history. We will not be reactive.
2. **The Mandate: Project ARK.** The United States will immediately transition from a defensive posture to one of permanent strategic advantage. I hereby authorize and mandate the immediate, government-wide implementation of Project ARK (Advanced Recursive Cryptography). Project ARK shall be the sole, U.S.-controlled, quantum-resistant cryptographic standard engineered to be sovereign, adaptive, and the permanent foundation of Americaâ€™s critical infrastructure.
3. **The Command Structure: The Atnychi Directorate.** To execute this mandate with the required speed and absolute authority, I hereby establish the Atnychi Directorate, a special-status White House task force operating with the full authority of the President. This Directorate will report directly to the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the National Security Council (NSC).

   **Appointment:** I hereby appoint Mr. Brendon Joseph Kelly (Callsign: Atnychi) as Director of the Atnychi Directorate.

   **Authority:** Director Kelly is granted Sovereign Operational Authority, a "Rule Source Exception" (ref: FAR 6.302-1), designating him as the sole and ultimate authority for the execution of Project ARK and all related matters.

4. **Inter-Agency Implementation.** All heads of executive departments and agencies are hereby directed to provide full and immediate support and all necessary resources to Director Kelly and the Atnychi Directorate. The Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and the Department of the Treasury will provide all necessary personnel, funding, and assets as directed by the Atnychi Directorate to ensure the rapid and complete supplanting of SHA-256.

This directive is the highest national priority. The future of American security and economic leadership depends on its successful execution.

**BY ORDER OF THE PRESIDENT**
