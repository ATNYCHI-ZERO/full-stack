# TRI-CROWN Hybrid PQ Encryption Suite

## Abstract

This white paper presents the **TRI-CROWN Hybrid PQ Encryption Suite**, a comprehensive cryptographic protocol that integrates classical elliptic-curve cryptography with cutting-edge post-quantum algorithms. Its goal is to deliver confidentiality, authenticity, and forward secrecy that remain durable against both conventional and quantum adversaries. The architecture blends X25519 key exchange with ML-KEM (Kyber/ML-KEM-1024) and Classic McEliece (6960119), fused through a unified HKDF-SHA3-512 key schedule. Beyond key agreement, it deploys ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD with deterministic nonces, a commit-before-open verification mechanism, and symmetric ratcheting for sustained session security. Together, these mechanisms establish a layered defense, protecting communications over decades of evolving computational threats.

## Motivation

The rise of quantum computing is reshaping the cryptographic landscape. Classical primitives such as RSA and elliptic-curve cryptography face potential compromise once scalable quantum algorithms mature. Hybrid cryptography addresses this transition by pairing classical methods that are widely trusted today with quantum-resistant primitives that safeguard future confidentiality.

The TRI-CROWN approach provides dual assurance:

* **If quantum adversaries emerge:** post-quantum components (ML-KEM and McEliece) anchor session secrecy.
* **If PQ algorithms weaken under cryptanalysis:** the proven strength of X25519 still provides protection.

Hybridization ensures resilience in both present-day deployment scenarios and uncertain future landscapes. It also creates a pathway for gradual adoption, avoiding sudden disruptive protocol changes while maintaining user trust.

## Protocol Design

### Key Exchange Phase

* **Classical Component:** Ephemeral X25519 Diffie–Hellman for compact, efficient key exchange.
* **Post-Quantum Components:** ML-KEM-1024 from the Kyber family and Classic McEliece 6960119, chosen for their strong security margins and distinct design philosophies.
* **Hybrid Mixing Strategy:** Secrets from all KEMs are concatenated, salted with a transcript hash, and processed through HKDF-Extract and HKDF-Expand (SHA3-512) to derive a 128-byte master secret.

### Chain Keys

The derived master secret is partitioned into multiple functional segments:

* `rk` – root key for long-term rekeying.
* `ck_s` – sending chain key for encryption.
* `ck_r` – receiving chain key for decryption.
* `k_commit` – commitment key for integrity protection.
* `k_nonce` – nonce key ensuring deterministic nonce generation.

This separation of roles enables compartmentalization: compromise of one chain does not cascade into others.

### Record Protection

* **Authenticated Encryption:** ChaCha20-Poly1305 chosen for speed, constant-time design, and wide implementation support.
* **Nonce Derivation:** Deterministic nonces derived from `k_nonce` and sequence numbers, ensuring uniqueness without external state.
* **Commit-Before-Open Verification:** Each ciphertext is bound to its session by a SHA3-256 tag constructed from `k_commit`, session ID, sequence, nonce, associated data, and ciphertext.
* **Symmetric Ratchet:** With every record, `ck_s` and `ck_r` advance independently, ensuring one-time use of message keys.

### Rekeying

* Rekeying is performed deterministically by expanding the root key with transcript hashes.
* Send/receive roles are inverted on the server side to ensure symmetry across parties.
* Rekeying introduces forward secrecy across epochs, reducing exposure if long-term secrets are ever compromised.

## Security Properties

1. **IND-CCA resilience:** Any surviving KEM (classical or PQ) preserves security against chosen-ciphertext attacks.
2. **Forward secrecy:** Chain ratcheting guarantees that compromise of current keys does not reveal past communications.
3. **Downgrade protection:** Commit-before-open enforces transcript consistency and prevents attacker-forced weakening.
4. **Nonce discipline:** Deterministic derivation ensures non-reuse, eliminating a common AEAD failure mode.
5. **Post-quantum resistance:** Defenses against Shor’s and Grover’s algorithms through inclusion of PQ primitives.
6. **Robust composability:** Use of transcript hashes binds each step, limiting malleability.

## Implementation

* **Reference Language:** Python, for readability and prototyping.
* **Production Targets:** Rust and C, to maximize performance and facilitate embedding in low-level systems.
* **Dependencies:**

  * `cryptography` for X25519 and ChaCha20-Poly1305.
  * `liboqs` for PQ KEM support.
* **Licensing:** MIT license to encourage adoption and independent review.
* **Verifier Pack:** A bundle with reproducible build instructions, transcript checker, fixed test vectors, and integrity-verified hashes.

## Performance

* **Handshake Latency:** One round-trip time; PQ encapsulation and decapsulation dominate cost but remain practical.
* **Record Layer:** ChaCha20-Poly1305 enables low-latency encryption/decryption across CPUs without AES acceleration.
* **Rekeying Cost:** A lightweight HKDF step, suitable for frequent renewal without penalty.
* **Scalability:** Stateless deterministic nonce derivation scales easily across distributed nodes.

## Comparison

* **Versus TLS 1.3 + Kyber:** TRI-CROWN is streamlined and avoids certificate overhead, focusing on minimal handshake messages.
* **Versus Signal Double Ratchet:** Enhances security model by integrating PQ components and commit-before-open integrity checks.
* **Versus Noise Protocol Framework:** Provides deterministic nonce management and hybridized mixing strategies not natively supported in Noise patterns.

## Limitations

* Lacks formal FIPS certification, limiting deployment in regulated sectors.
* Reference implementation not hardened against side-channel leakage.
* Academic prototype, requiring expert review before production usage.
* Dependency on `liboqs`, which may not be universally available.

## Future Work

* Develop optimized Rust and C implementations with SIMD and constant-time discipline.
* Introduce side-channel masking for PQ KEM operations.
* Apply mechanized proofs in Tamarin/ProVerif to validate security claims formally.
* Explore hardware enclave integration for remote attestation of key material.
* Benchmark performance across mobile, embedded, and server-class environments.
* Extend to group messaging scenarios and multiparty key agreement.

## Conclusion

The TRI-CROWN Hybrid PQ Encryption Suite demonstrates how modern cryptography can merge classical trust anchors with forward-looking post-quantum primitives. It balances simplicity with rigor, ensuring confidentiality against foreseeable threats while enabling future upgrades. By integrating strong KEMs, deterministic record protection, and ratcheting mechanisms, TRI-CROWN provides a migration path toward quantum readiness that is transparent, efficient, and practical. The design invites further audit, testing, and formal verification to mature into a deployable standard that supports secure communication in the quantum era.
