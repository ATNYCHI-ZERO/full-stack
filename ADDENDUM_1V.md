ADDENDUM 1V: Final Terms & Stipulations for a Mandated Valuation Process
TO: The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security (OUSDI&S/PSD); The Director of National Intelligence; The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; The Department of Defense General Counsel; The White House Counsel
FROM: Brendon Joseph Kelly (Hereinafter "the Principal")
SUBJECT: FINAL, BINDING, AND NON-NEGOTIABLE TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT
REFERENCE: PROTECTIVE OVERSIGHT DIRECTIVE (PDCN 25-333-Ω)

1.0 | Preamble and Instrument Finality
This document herein supersedes and renders permanently void all prior communications, drafts, and addenda related to this matter. It constitutes the final and irrevocable terms of engagement. This structured, time-bound process for strategic alignment is presented as a necessary consequence of a documented pattern of procedural non-compliance and strategic delay on the part of the United States Government, including but not limited to actions construed as the inducement of legal jeopardy through administrative means. Any failure to formally accept and execute the stipulations contained herein shall be considered a final declination of this offer. It must be understood that this document is not an invitation to negotiation but represents the final set of conditions precedent to the prevention of a catastrophic strategic loss for the United States.

2.0 | Stipulations of the Principal
The execution of the stipulations within Term 2.1 by the United States Government shall be deemed to constitute its full, unconditional, and legally binding acceptance of this entire agreement. Any failure to adhere to the explicit timelines established in Term 2.1 or Term 2.2 will result in the immediate and permanent termination of all obligations on the part of the Principal, an act which shall constitute a material breach of this agreement by the United States Government.

2.1 | Term A: Prerequisite Engagement Fee & Verification of Sincerity
Action: An immediate, non-refundable, and unrestricted disbursement in the sum of Five Million United States Dollars ($5,000,000.00 USD) shall be made to the Principal. The transfer is to be executed via federal wire to the Principal's designated financial institution (Mercury Bank, account information currently on file with the United States Treasury) as a "clean funds" wire, unencumbered by any holds, reviews, or subsequent clawback provisions.
Purpose: This sum is designated for the immediate retention of premier legal and financial counsel with specialized expertise in national security law and intellectual property valuation, the establishment of a secure operational fund for the Principal and his designees, and to serve as a tangible demonstration of good faith. It is stipulated that this is not an advance or loan, but a prerequisite fee for engagement.
Timeline: Cleared and accessible funds must be available to the Principal within seventy-two (72) hours of this document's official registration by OUSDI&S.

2.2 | Term B: Unconditional and Irreversible Legal Restoration
Action: A complete, total, and unconditional expungement of all extant criminal, civil, or administrative proceedings—at the federal, state, and local levels—pertaining to the following individuals is hereby mandated:
Brendon Joseph Kelly
Korre Fuller
Christopher Michael Cervantez
Scope of Action: The mandated expungement shall encompass the physical and digital purge of all records from all relevant databases (including, but not limited to, NCIC, CJIS), the sealing of all court records, the full restoration of all civil rights inclusive of Second Amendment rights, and the formal issuance of letters of clearance from the Department of Justice. This term constitutes a permanent bar against any future legal or administrative action related to these past matters.
Timeline: All necessary executive, judicial, and administrative actions must be fully executed, with official confirmation delivered to the Principal, within twenty-four (24) hours of this document's official registration.

2.3 | Term C: The Biphasic Valuation and Settlement Process
A mandatory timeline of twenty-four (24) months is hereby established, divided into two distinct and sequential phases, for the final settlement.

2.3.1 | Phase 1: Comprehensive Asset Valuation (18 Months)
Action: A mandatory, good-faith, and transparent process shall be undertaken to ascertain the full, fair, and comprehensive strategic value of the intellectual property designated as "K Math" and all its associated derivatives. This valuation will be conducted by a joint committee composed of designated representatives from the United States Government (to include NIST, DoD, Treasury) and the Principal's retained counsel, with the inclusion of mutually agreed-upon independent auditors. The valuation must encompass not only the technology itself, but also its projected impact on military dominance, economic security, and intelligence supremacy.
Timeline: This valuation process shall commence immediately upon the execution of Term 2.1 and shall be concluded with a mutually agreed-upon final valuation figure no later than eighteen (18) months from the date of this document's registration.

2.3.2 | Phase 2: Settlement and Transfer of Title (6 Months)
Action: Subsequent to the agreement on the final valuation, a six (6) month period is mandated to structure and execute the necessary legal and financial instruments for the transfer of compensation to the Principal. This includes the establishment of legal trusts for the heritable royalty payments as stipulated in Term 2.6.
Timeline: The initial tranche of the agreed-upon settlement must be transferred to the Principal no later than six (6) months following the conclusion of Phase 1.

2.4 | Term D: Consequences of Non-Compliance
Action: In the event of non-compliance by the United States Government with the stipulated timelines for Term 2.1, Term 2.2, or either phase of Term 2.3, this agreement shall be rendered null and void ab initio.
Result: The Principal's obligation of strategic exclusivity shall be irrevocably terminated, thereby granting the Principal the legal and moral right to sell, license, or transfer the intellectual property to any sovereign or commercial entity as he may choose. This outcome will be considered a direct result of a material breach by the United States Government, releasing the Principal from any and all non-disclosure or national security obligations.

2.5 | Term E: Immediate Provision of Operational and Security Support
Action: The immediate provision of the following resources and designations by the United States Government is required:
Designation of Strategic Ally: This status, affording the Principal and his team operational immunity from non-felony prosecution, is to be codified in a classified presidential finding.
Secure Infrastructure: Provision of military-grade encrypted computers, communications devices, and a secure internet connection guaranteed immune from surveillance by any U.S. agency.
A Direct, High-Level Liaison: A dedicated point-of-contact (at the GS-15 or O-6 rank equivalent) vested with the direct authority to resolve inter-agency conflicts on the Principal's behalf.
Full-time Personal Protection: A U.S. Marshals SOG detail for the Principal, his team, and their immediate families, whose primary mission parameter is absolute safety, superseding standard agency protocols.
Timeline: All support and designations must be in place and fully operational within seventy-two (72) hours of this document's registration.

2.6 | Term F: The Legacy Mandate (Non-Negotiable)
Action: It is stipulated that the provisions concerning a perpetual and heritable royalty (passing to the Principal's daughter and her subsequent lineage) and the permanent "Powered by K Systems" attribution on all derivative technology shall constitute non-negotiable components of any final settlement structured in Phase 2. The valuation in Phase 1 shall inform the scale of this royalty but not its existence nor its ten percent (10%) floor.

3.0 | Acceptance and Waiver of Claims
The transfer of the fund as stipulated in Term 2.1 shall serve as the formal, unconditional, and irrevocable acceptance of this entire process-based ultimatum by the United States Government. Said act of acceptance shall further constitute a full and final waiver by the United States Government of any future claims of duress, misrepresentation, or coercion in the formation of this agreement. The terms are presented with clarity; the decision rests with the addressed parties.
